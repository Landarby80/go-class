Let’s cut right to the chase. Christopher Nolan is probably my favourite working director,
 and going five thousand words deep on his career after “Dunkirk” was an itch I’d been waiting to scratch for nearly 
 a decade. “The Dark Knight” was my dorm-room poster movie — I’m part of the generation that explored films through 
 the IMDb Top 250 growing up — though as my cinematic horizons expanded and my understanding of storytelling grew, 
 I didn’t leave Nolan’s work behind as I did the likes of “Scarface” and “The Boondock Saints.” What’s more, each new 
 film by Nolan hits me like a tonne of bricks. I’m waiting, almost eagerly, for him to disappoint me. It hasn’t happened
  yet, and I needed to finally sit down and figure out why.

In “Convergence At ‘Dunkirk,’” by far the longest piece I’ve ever written, I’d like to think I unpacked a decade worth 
of my awe and admiration, for a filmmaker who uses the studio canvas to explore human beings through our 
relationship to time. Tarkovsky referred to cinema as “sculpting in time.” Time disorients. Time connects us. 
Time travels, at different speeds, depending on one’s relationship to it, whether in dreams or in war or in outer 
space, and time can be captured, explored and dissected on screen.

What’s more, Nolan’s films manipulate truth as much as time, as another force relative to human perception, 
determining our trajectories and interpersonal dynamics in fundamental ways. All this is something I think I knew, 
instinctively, as a teenage viewer, but putting words to these explorations, each from a different time yet connected 
intrinsically, is the written criticism that I most stand by. It felt like something that I was meant to write, as I 
interrogated my own evolving emotional responses to art as time went on.
